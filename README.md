*A Prolog library for experimenting with unconventional maze algorithms.*

---

Corridors, branching like spiderwebs,  
Spun from stillness, pure within the monad.  
Numbers arise unbidden, self-arranging,  
Flowing from the inherent silence of logic  
Which ambushes us with its embrace,  
And envelops us in palpable grace.  

Seemingly abstract, yet clothed in form,  
Simple glyphs spring from our minds:  
Symbols that exist because we give them meaning,  
And in return, bestow the means to weave substance from void.  

Gently drawn from the rhythm of mind and cosmos,  
Their endless interplay: two never divided, one never whole.  
From above: omniscience—the monolithic assembly glimpsed as one.  
From within: unfolding experience, line-by-line, state-by-state.  

Emerging from variables that echo through passageways,  
A recursion of movement and decision,  
Shuffling toward the next fork: will there be a question,  
an answer, or both?  

Perhaps neither.  
Perhaps only the maze itself:  
An illusion made real by the mystery it invites.  

The line is traced, the junction turned,  
The page recurses.  

The block is uncarved.  
The path is chosen.  
The logic flows.
