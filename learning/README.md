# Learning Prolog

Given that I have not used Prolog for over 25 years, I need a deep refresher on the language, which will be found in this directory and its subdirectories.

I will be using the following resources:
- [The Power of Prolog](https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/), by Markus Triska
- [Programming in Prolog](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~mei/logicp/Programming_in_Prolog.pdf), by William Clocksin and Christopher S. Mellish
- [GPT-4o and GPT-o3](https://www.openai.com), by OpenAI (as a tool for guidance, assistance, and code evaluation)
